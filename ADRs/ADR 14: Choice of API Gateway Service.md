## ADR 14: Choice of API Gateway Service

### Context
We need to decide on the API Gateway service to manage and expose our application's APIs to external clients.

### Decision
We will use Amazon API Gateway as our API Gateway service.

### Decision Rationale

- Amazon API Gateway offers robust API management and integration capabilities.
- It integrates seamlessly with other AWS services, simplifying API development.
- API Gateway aligns with our AWS-based architecture and provides scalability.

### Implications
- Configuration of API endpoints, methods, security, and usage plans is required.
- Integration of API Gateway with backend services.

### Dependencies
Set up Amazon API Gateway resources and define API endpoints.

### Implementation Details
- Define and configure RESTful or WebSocket API endpoints in API Gateway.
- Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms for API access.
### Monitoring and Testing
- Monitor API usage, traffic, and error rates.
- Test API endpoints for functionality and performance.

### Open Issues
Implementation of rate limiting, caching, and API versioning strategies.
