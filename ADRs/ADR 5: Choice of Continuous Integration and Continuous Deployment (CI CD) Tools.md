## ADR 5: Choice of Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) Tools

### Context
We need to decide on the CI/CD tools and practices for automating the deployment of our application.

### Decision
We will use AWS CodePipeline and AWS CodeBuild as our primary CI/CD tools for automating the deployment pipeline.

### Decision Rationale
+ AWS CodePipeline offers a fully managed CI/CD service with integration to other AWS services.
+ AWS CodeBuild provides build and test capabilities for a wide range of platforms.
+ These tools align with our AWS-based architecture, enhancing integration and scalability.

### Implications
+ Configuration of CI/CD pipelines, stages, and build environments is required.
+ Definition of deployment scripts, testing strategies, and automated testing suites.

### Dependencies
+ Set up AWS CodePipeline pipelines and define deployment stages.
+ Configure AWS CodeBuild build environments and scripts.

### Implementation Details
+ Define CI/CD pipelines with stages for building, testing, and deploying microservices.
+ Automate the deployment of microservices using AWS CodeDeploy or Kubernetes deployment manifests.

### Monitoring and Testing
+ Monitor CI/CD pipeline executions and deployment success.
+ Test deployment processes and rollback procedures.

### Open Issues
+ Integration of CI/CD pipelines with version control and issue tracking systems.
+ Implementation of blue-green deployments or canary releases for safe production updates.
