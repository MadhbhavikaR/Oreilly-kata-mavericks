## ADR 11: Centralized vs. Service-Specific Logging
### Context
We must decide whether to implement centralized logging and auditing or rely on service-specific logging for our application.

### Decision
We chose to implement centralized logging and auditing for our application.

### Decision Rationale
+ *Standardization of Data:* Centralized logging ensures the standardization of the data that is captured across different components and services. This consistency simplifies log analysis and troubleshooting.
+ *Alerting and Monitoring:* The centralized logging and auditing service can be enhanced to trigger alerts based on specific business or technical errors. Detecting and addressing issues in advance can lead to faster resolution, cost savings, and an improved overall customer experience.

### Implications
+ *Logging Infrastructure:* We need to establish and maintain a centralized logging infrastructure that can handle the volume of logs generated by various services and components.
+ *Integration:* All services and components must be integrated with the centralized logging service to ensure that relevant data is captured.

### Alternatives Considered
We considered relying solely on service-specific logging. While this approach can work for individual components, it may result in fragmented log data and make it more challenging to identify and respond to issues across the entire system.

### Decision Outcome
This decision prioritizes consistency, visibility, and the ability to proactively address issues through centralized logging and auditing. It aligns with our goal of efficiently managing and monitoring our application's health and performance.
