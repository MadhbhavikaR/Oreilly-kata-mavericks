## ADR 1: Native vs. Hybrid Application

### Context

We need to decide on the approach for developing our application: as a native application or a hybrid application.

### Decision

We will develop our application as a hybrid responsive application initially, with plans to expand to a native application for mobile devices in the *future*.

### Decision Rationale
+ A hybrid approach allows for cross-platform compatibility, reducing development time and costs.
+ It enables a faster initial release to the market.
+ Plans for web and native apps align with scalability and user accessibility.
+ Using a hybrid application developerâ€™s learning curve would be lesser and code management would be easy.

### Implications

+ Development frameworks for hybrid app platforms (e.g., React Native, Flutter, Ionic) must be chosen.
+ Future development will require transitioning to web and native platforms simultaneously.

### Dependencies

Select and configure a hybrid app development framework.

### Implementation Details

+ Develop the initial hybrid application with shared code and user interface.
+ Plan for web and native app development as separate projects in the future.

### Monitoring and Testing

+ Continuous testing for cross-platform compatibility and user experience.
+ Monitor user feedback for feature prioritization in native apps.

### Open Issues:

Detailed plans and timelines for native app development.
