# ADR 13: JavaScript vs. Other Development Frameworks

## Context
We need to decide whether to use JavaScript as our primary development language and framework or explore alternatives for our travel management application. This decision impacts various aspects, including frontend and backend consistency, event-driven features, database compatibility, non-blocking IO, available open-source packages, and hosting options.

## Decision
We chose JavaScript as the primary development language and framework for our travel management application.

## Decision Rationale
- **Consistency with Frontend**: Choosing JavaScript complements our decision to create a hybrid frontend. This allows us to maintain consistency in terms of language, frameworks, and runtime between the frontend and backend components. This consistency can lead to improved development efficiency and ease of maintenance.
- **Event-Driven Features**: A significant portion of our application's features is event-driven and relies on JSON data. JavaScript, with its native support for JSON, is well-suited for handling these event-driven requirements efficiently.
- **Database Compatibility**: Our database is a document store, and JavaScript-based applications can work seamlessly with JSON objects, eliminating the need for costly serialization and deserialization processes.
- **Non-blocking IO**: JavaScript, especially when using Node.js, provides non-blocking IO, which can significantly enhance parallelism in our application. This is crucial for handling concurrent requests and optimizing performance.
- **Abundance of Open Source Packages**: The JavaScript ecosystem offers an extensive collection of open-source packages and a vibrant community. This provides us with access to a wide range of libraries and solutions to address various requirements, potentially reducing development time.
- **Hosting and CDN**: A JavaScript-based application can efficiently leverage S3-based web hosting and Content Delivery Network (CDN) caching, enhancing our application's scalability, speed, and availability.

## Implications
- **Team Skills**: Team members may need to acquire or strengthen their JavaScript skills, especially if they are more familiar with other programming languages.
- **Node.js**: If we choose Node.js for backend development, we need to ensure that our team is proficient in Node.js development practices.
- **Ecosystem Management**: We must actively manage dependencies and packages from the JavaScript ecosystem to maintain application stability and security.

## Alternatives Considered
We considered alternative development languages and frameworks but found that JavaScript aligns well with our specific requirements, including frontend/backend consistency, event-driven nature, database compatibility, and existing ecosystem.

## Decision Outcome
This decision to use JavaScript as the primary development language and framework aligns with our application's needs and goals. It ensures consistency, efficiency, and compatibility with our document store database, enhancing our ability to deliver a robust travel management application.
