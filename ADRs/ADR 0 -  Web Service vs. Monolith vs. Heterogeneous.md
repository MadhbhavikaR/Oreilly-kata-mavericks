# ADR 0: Web Service vs. Monolith vs. Heterogeneous

## Context
We need to decide on the architectural approach for our application: Web Service, Monolith, or Heterogeneous microservices.

## Decision
We will adopt a Heterogeneous microservices architecture for our application.

## Decision Rationale
- Heterogeneous microservices allow us to break down functionality into smaller, manageable services.
- This architecture offers better scalability, fault isolation, and flexibility.
- It aligns with our goal of building a scalable and maintainable system.

## Implications
- Development and deployment complexity will increase compared to a monolith.
- We must implement effective service communication and orchestration.

## Dependencies
- Service discovery and communication mechanisms need to be established.

## Implementation Details
- Define service boundaries and responsibilities.
- Establish communication patterns (REST, gRPC, etc.).
- Implement service orchestration and monitoring.

## Monitoring and Testing
- Implement monitoring solutions for each microservice.
- Test service interactions and scalability.

## Open Issues
- Service versioning and backward compatibility strategy.
