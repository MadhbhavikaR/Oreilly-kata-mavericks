## ADR 7: Cloud vs. Self-Hosting for Infrastructure Deployment
### Context
We are faced with the decision of whether to deploy our application infrastructure in the cloud or opt for self-hosting. This decision is crucial as it impacts our application's scalability, cost-effectiveness, manageability, and availability.

### Decision
We choose to deploy our application infrastructure in the cloud, specifically leveraging a major cloud service provider such as AWS, Azure, or GCP.

### Decision Rationale
+ *Pay-Per-Use Model:* Cloud services offer a pay-per-use pricing model. This aligns with our financial goals, allowing us to scale infrastructure resources according to actual demand. This eliminates the need for upfront capital investment in hardware.

+ *Extensive Service Offerings:* Cloud providers offer an extensive catalogue of services, including compute, storage, databases, networking, AI/ML, and more. These services can be easily added or removed as needed, enabling us to focus on core business functionalities rather than managing infrastructure components.

+ *Managed Services:* Cloud providers offer managed services that significantly reduce infrastructure management tasks. This includes software updates, patching, security, and even tuning. This reduces operational overhead and associated costs.

+ *Monitoring and Observability:* Cloud platforms provide implicit monitoring, observability, and alerting capabilities. These built-in tools and services help us proactively manage the health and performance of our applications, leading to better system reliability.

+ *Availability and Scalability:* Cloud providers guarantee high availability (e.g., five 9's or 99.999%) and offer scalability features. With the proper implementation of managed services and elasticity, we can efficiently handle traffic spikes and ensure uninterrupted service availability.

### Implications
+ *Dependency on Cloud Provider:* We will depend on the chosen cloud provider's services and infrastructure. Migrating away from the cloud may require effort and planning.
+ *Cost Management:* While the pay-per-use model can be cost-effective, it also requires diligent cost monitoring and optimization to avoid unexpected expenses.
+ *Security and Compliance:* We must ensure that we adhere to security best practices and compliance requirements in the cloud environment.
+ *Training:* Team members may need training to effectively utilize cloud services and infrastructure management tools.

### Alternatives Considered
+ Self-hosting was considered as an alternative, but it was deemed less favourable due to the following reasons:
+ Higher upfront infrastructure costs.
+ Increased operational overhead for hardware management, software updates, and scaling.
+ Limited ability to leverage managed services and automation.
+ Potentially lower availability and scalability compared to cloud solutions.

### Decision Outcome
This decision to deploy our application infrastructure in the cloud aligns with our goals of cost-effectiveness, scalability, manageability, and availability. It allows us to leverage the extensive resources and services provided by cloud providers while focusing on delivering value to our users.
